 What is Git?
 
Git is a version control system that helps you track changes in your code. Think of it as a time machine for your codeâ€”you can go back to previous versions, see what changed, and work with others without messing up the project.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
  1. Distributed Version Control:

      Every developer has a complete copy of the project, making collaboration faster and more reliable.

  3. Tracking Changes:

       Git records every modification, allowing you to go back to previous versions if needed.

  5. Branching & Merging:
      You can create separate branches to work on different features or fixes and later merge them into the main project.

  6. Collaboration:

      Multiple developers can work on the same project without overwriting each other's changes.

  8. Speed & Performance:
      Git is optimized for speed, making commits, branching, and merging efficient.

  9. Undo Mistakes (Rollback & Revert):

      If something goes wrong, you can undo changes using commands like git reset or git revert.

  11. Security:

       Git uses cryptographic hashing (SHA-1) to ensure data integrity and prevent tampering.

  13. Staging Area:

       Git has a staging area where you can prepare changes before committing, giving more control over what gets saved.

  14. Open Source & Free:

       Git is free to use and widely supported across all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).

  16. Support for Remote Repositories:

       You can push your code to remote repositories (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) for backup and team collaboration.
